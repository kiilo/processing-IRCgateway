<h1>proccessing OSC IRC gateway</ h1>

this gateway was used in my workshop "internet of the things" @ NTUA TW 2010.playaround.cc

Move this folder to your processing sketches folder and restart processing
the project IrcGateway will be accessible under /File/Sketchebook/IrcGateway

all neccessary liberies are included in the right place, move just the whole 
folder!

edit the config pane in processing
